There is a message bubble icon that you can click on to message the retailer directly through Faire Messenger and follow-up on their feedback.\n\n\n\nTo see the exact products that were returned from an order, you can search the order number in your Orders page and click to view the order details. Within the Item List you can view the product status, which will indicate which products were returned.\n\n\n\nHave questions about your analytics?
