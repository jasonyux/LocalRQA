This means that as customers purchase your products on other platforms and your inventory counts in Shopify decrease, the updated inventory counts will be automatically adjusted on Faire as well. However, it's important to note that this inventory sync is one-way – it only updates inventory levels on Faire when they change in Shopify, not the other way around.\n\nTo facilitate this process, you can sync your Shopify inventory with Faire based on your inventory locations, which can be found in the 'settings' section of your Shopify Integration. If you need both Shopify and your other system(s) to reflect updated inventory levels every time an order is placed on Faire, you must also use the order sync component of the integration."}

These tags assist retailers in discovering products more effectively by allowing them to see these attributes on product listings, use them in filters, and identify them in featured collections, among other possibilities. The benefit for retailers is that they can more easily find products that meet their specific needs or preferences, which can streamline their search process and potentially lead to better product selections for their stores. The document also notes that Faire is continuously working on adding new attribute tags to further improve product discoverability for retailers."}

This includes making sure that they are a retailer, they are still in business, and you have an existing business relationship with them or have interacted with them before. In the case of new leads, you should have no reason to believe they wouldn’t want to hear from you. Additionally, you should compare your list against your own \"unsubscribe\" list to ensure that the retailers you are contacting have not already asked you not to contact them. It's also important to purge any irrelevant data or unsubscribed email addresses from the list before uploading it to your Customers list on Faire Direct. Remember to only use legitimate business email addresses that have given consent to be contacted by your brand."}

In other words, once they register for VAT in France to deal with imports, they cannot benefit from the de minimis threshold and must account for VAT on all their supplies within France."}

The recipient's postal code might be invalid due to a typo or an improperly placed space. You should check the postal code for accuracy and correct any errors before attempting to fulfill the order again.\n\n2. The retailer's address contains a post office (PO) box, but the carrier in question does not ship to PO boxes. In this case, you would need to contact the retailer to provide an alternative address that is not a PO box, or you must select a different carrier that can deliver to PO boxes.\n\n3. The carrier is unable to service the retailer’s address. This could be because the retailer is located in a rural area or another area that the carrier does not cover. If this is the case, you should choose another carrier or opt to ship the order on your own.\n\nIf after checking these possibilities you are still encountering an error, the document advises you to reach out to their support team using the \"Contact Us\" link at the bottom of their help center for further assistance."}
