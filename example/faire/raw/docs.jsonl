Insider members receive the following benefits as part of their membership:\nFree shipping on orders from select US brands.\nExclusive, early access to Faire\u2019s virtual trade shows and new brand arrivals on the site.\nPlease note, the Insider program for European retailers offers different benefits. To learn more about that program, see: How does Insider work for European retailers?\nWhere is Insider available, and how can I join?\nInsider is available to the majority of US retailers, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. You can sign up for a 30 day free trial by clicking the Insider button at the top of your home page, or you can join Insider right at the checkout when selecting your shipping method.\nHow much does Insider cost?\nAfter your free trial ends, your Insider membership fee of $19.99 will be charged monthly to the payment method you selected when signing up. The monthly membership fee helps ensure we can continue providing you exclusive benefits to maximize your savings when you shop on Faire.\nHow do I find brands with Insider Free Shipping on Faire?\nTo find brands and products that offer Insider free shipping, simply look for the Insider key while shopping.\nIf you\u2019d like to filter your shopping experience so you only see products with Insider free shipping, you can do so by clicking the Insider filter while browsing and toggling Insider free shipping on.\nHow does Faire select which brands have free shipping?\nThe brands selected for free shipping are personalized for each retailer. We account for a few factors in deciding which brands have shipping covered, including the brand\u2019s shipping location in proximity to you and the relevancy of the brand based on your expressed interest.\nPlease note, brands do not opt-in to the Insider program, and there is no way to request that a specific brand be included. We assess Insider's shipping coverage regularly, and occasionally make adjustments based on the estimated shipping and duties costs.\nDo brands pay for the shipping cost?\nIf a US brand is covered through Insider, Faire covers the cost of shipping through your Insider membership.\nWe\u2019ve launched a program for brands in Europe to partner with Faire to cover the cost of shipping for US Insiders. These brands wouldn\u2019t be covered under your regular Insider membership, however, if they\u2019ve opted into our Insider free shipping partnership program, they may be available to you through Insider.\nThis new partnership program allows brands to offer free shipping on eligible orders placed by US Insiders by splitting the cost with Faire. Brands will pay 50% of the total shipping, and we\u2019ll handle the rest of the shipping costs. We will also cover 100% of the import duties on eligible orders as part of the partnership program.\nAs part of this program, eligible brands can opt in or out at any time if they\u2019d like. If a brand opts out, they will no longer be covered through Insider, and shipping costs on future orders with that brand will be added to your invoice.\nHow does billing work?\nYou will be billed for Insider every 30 days from the date you first enroll. This payment will be charged using your default method of payment on Faire (i.e., your credit/ debit card or bank account). Unfortunately, we don\u2019t currently accept any other form of payment for Insider other than your default payment method on file.\nIf you\u2019d like to view any past payments you have made for your Insider membership, you can do so through your Insider tab.\nCan I pause my membership?\nYes! If you'd like to pause your membership, you can click on Cancel Membership, and then opt to pause your membership instead. If you click Pause My Membership, you can select how long you want to pause your membership for. Your membership pause will start on your next billing date.\nIf you choose to resume your paused membership, you can click on Resume Insider Membership on your Insider tab. This will show your monthly payment and card that is going to be charged again.\nOnce you resume your membership, you will be charged automatically on the exact day they resume it and then every 30 days from the resume date.\nCan I cancel my membership?\nYou can cancel before your trial ends to avoid incurring any charges. There is also no commitment to the program once your free trial is up so you can choose to cancel at any time during the duration of your membership without penalty.\nIf you decide to cancel your Insider membership before your next billing date, your membership will end at the end of that current billing cycle. For example, if your membership is scheduled to renew on June 30th, but you cancel it on June 15th, your membership will end on June 30th. You will have access to your Insider benefits up until that date.\nIf you would like to cancel your membership you can do so via the Insider Membership tab in the Account section of your Faire portal.\nOnce you cancel your membership your benefits will last until the end of your billing cycle."}

The goal is also to help brands limit where their products are sold, out of respect to existing stockists. However, if the brand does not have Faire Protection enabled, you may find the products in nearby retail locations.\nPlease note, only brick and mortar retailers are eligible for Faire protection. Faire protection will not apply to online or pop-up stores.\nHow it works\nFaire Protection is offered to all Faire brands. Once set, the first retailer to place an order with the brand will have a 90-day exclusivity for the zip/postal code where their shop is located. Exclusivity starts when the order is placed, and the 90-day clock starts when the order is confirmed.\nFor example, if you just placed an order with a Faire Protected brand, and another retailer in your same zip/postal code tries to place an order with the same brand, they will receive the Faire Protection message shown below. This message indicates that they are blocked from ordering. After 90 days, if you do not reorder from the brand, you give up your Faire Protection and another retailer will then be able to place an order.\nIf your order is canceled, or you return an entire order, your Faire Protection will end automatically. You can renew it by placing another order with the brand.\nPlease note: Faire Protection only applies to orders placed on Faire. We cannot guarantee exclusivity in your zip/postal code beyond purchases placed on our site.\nWhy do I see another retailer in my zip/postal code stocking a brand I have protection with?\nWhile Faire Protection allows you to lock in exclusivity in your zip/postal code with a brand, there may be times when another retailer will be able to order from this brand as well. Retailers that have a relationship with a brand from before Faire are still allowed to order with that brand. This could happen if, for example, the retailer referred the brand through our referral program, or the retailer joined Faire with an invitation from the brand, through the brand's unique link."}

We offer net 60 terms so you can buy the optimal amount of inventory for your store, while managing your cash flow.\nWith 60-day payment terms, Faire covers the upfront cost of your order. When you order using this payment option, you won\u2019t be charged for your items until 60 days after the date you placed the order. If the order takes more than 14 days to ship, your invoice will be due 60 days after the ship date instead.\nOnce you pay off an invoice, that amount is returned to your available 60-day payment terms, and you can continue to place more orders using this buy now, pay later structure.\nIf you place an order that exceeds your available payment terms, you\u2019ll simply be charged for the entire order once it ships, regardless of remaining net terms.\nHow does Faire assign net 60 terms?\nAt sign-up, eligible retailers are given an initial amount of money they can spend using 60-day payment terms. You may also be required to link your bank, point-of-sale system, or accounting system in order to help verify your eligibility. For more information, please see our Privacy Policy.\nWill my available net 60 terms ever change?\nAs your business continues to evolve, we will periodically review the initial payment terms you got when you first signed up for Faire.\nWhen making payment terms adjustments, we will take into account any changes to your business type, size, or location, as well as your payment history, financial information, and/or additional self-reported sales information.\nHow can I increase my net 60 terms?\nThere are several ways to increase the amount of money you can spend using 60-day payment terms on Faire, including but not limited to:\nPaying your invoices on time\nMaintaining healthy return rates\nReturning items in good condition\nUtilizing your existing, available terms\nLinking your point-of-sale system and/or bank to Faire\nAdditionally, you may apply for an increase from your Faire account. During the application process, we\u2019ll request additional information about your business.\nKeep in mind that as long as you do not have overdue invoices, you can always order above your terms limit by choosing the option to pay on shipment during checkout.\nCreating multiple accounts in order to circumvent net 60 terms limits is against Faire's policies, and Faire may take appropriate action on the accounts if necessary.\nWhat if I don't qualify for net 60 terms?\nIf you do not qualify for net 60 terms, your payment will be due when the order is shipped by the brand.

Phishing is the term used for internet theft scams involving phony websites, emails or other messages, allowing the attacker can gain access to your account and sensitive information.\nThe following information will help you identify and avoid internet scams and phishing attempts:\nKnow the warning signs\nUnderstanding the warning signs will help you protect yourself against phishing. Keep an eye out for these signs when reading messages and reviewing websites:\nOverly general language: Although phishing can be well researched and tailored to you and your business, general language is a hallmark of phishing scams. Be wary of messages that seem to come from an organization you trust but that open with vague statements.\nMake sure your connection to a website uses https://:  When you connect to any website where you could be asked to enter a username and password or other sensitive data, check that a lock icon appears beside the URL in your browser.\nURL's that don't look quite right: Phishing attempts can include URLs that appear legitimate if you don't look too closely. Many phishing attempts use URLs that have been deliberately chosen to resemble a URL that you're already familiar with. For example:\nLegitimate URL: example-wholesale.com/apparel/tops\nPhony URL: example-wholesale.com-apparel.net/tops\nBusiness messages from personal accounts: Attackers can gather enough information from your online presence to create a message that could plausibly come from a real contact.\nMisspellings, poor grammar, and style variations: Criminals don't take content style guides as seriously as professional web content writers. As well as typos and grammar errors, variations in the following categories within a single page can show that a website is fraudulent.\nAlarmist or overexcited tone: Watch for time-sensitive requests that try to scare you into acting without thinking.\nOpen only attachments or links you expect: Don\u2019t interact with attachments, links, or forms unless you are expecting them and know what they contain. Not only can they redirect you to a malicious site designed to steal your information, but they can also infect your device with malware.\nBe careful with public wi-fi: Public wi-fi is convenient when you're on the go, but it provides many different ways for criminals to gain access to your information. You can reduce your risks by taking steps to protect yourself and your data by:\nVerifying hotspot names: Before connecting, make sure that the hotspot you plan to use is legitimate. If you can't see the hotspot name posted in an obvious place, then ask an employee.\nDisable access points to your device: Public wi-fi networks are much less secure than private networks like the one at your home or office. Protect yourself by turning off file sharing within your network and enabling your firewall before connecting. Even with these precautions, it's still not a good idea to send or receive any sensitive content using a public wi-fi network.\nIf you feel you have received any phishing messages, please reach out to us using the \"Contact Us\" button below and we will help address your questions or concerns.\n"}

For example, if a retailer places an order for $100 and a $20 promotion has been applied to the order by the brand, the VAT or GST due on the transaction is calculated by multiplying the applicable VAT rate by $80 ($100 less the $20 discount). As a result, the order total would be calculated as follows.\n$80 + [VAT or GST rate * $80]\nFaire funded promotions\nThere may also be times when an order is reduced by the application of a Faire funded promotion. When a promotion is funded by Faire, it does not reduce the taxable value of an order or the taxable value of the individual products. Faire funded promotions act like a credit offered to the retailer's payment of the order.\nIn these scenarios, Faire is covering a part of the retailer\u2019s cost by agreeing to make a payment directly to the brand on the retailer\u2019s behalf. VAT or GST is due on the total amount received by a brand. Therefore, the VAT or GST will still be calculated on the order subtotal before the Faire funded promotion. In the above scenario, if a retailer places an order for $100 and a $20 Faire-funded promotion is applied to the order, the order invoice will show the following.\n$80 + [VAT rate * $100]\nBrand funded and Faire funded promotions\nIn certain circumstances, there may be both brand and Faire funded promotions on the same order invoice. In that scenario, the brand funded promotion is applied first and the VAT or GST due is calculated by applying the appropriate VAT or GST rate to that reduced amount. The Faire funded promotion is then applied to the balance and only decreases the total payable amount for the retailer, as stated on the order invoice.\nTaking an example, using a VAT rate of 20% and where the transaction is for $100, and both a brand funded promotion of $10 and a Faire-funded promotion of $20 are applied, the order invoice would show an amount due of $88, calculated as follows.\nOrder subtotal: $100\nLess: Brand funded promotion ($10)\nTaxable value: $90\nVAT at 20%: $18\nNew subtotal: $108\nLess: Faire funded promotion ($20)\nTotal amount payable: $88"}

Your practices should include at least one of the following:\nAt least 75% of your products and packaging are made from upcycled or recycled materials or sustainably sourced raw materials\nAt least 75% of your products and packaging are compostable or biodegradable\nAt least 75% of your ingredients are vegan, nontoxic, Fair trade, and/or hold organic certifications\nYour business is carbon neutral: Your business removes or offsets as much CO2 from the atmosphere as it produces\nNot on Amazon : Your brand\u2019s products cannot be found on Amazon. Your brand doesn\u2019t sell your products directly on Amazon or distribute your products to sellers who list your products on Amazon.\nHandmade : All your products are made or designed by you or your team. Your brand does not work with an external production partner or mass produce your products.\nGives back : Your brand donates a portion of proceeds to a non-profit or charity.\nOrganic: Your brand uses all certified organic materials.\nWe recommend you add more details on your organic certifications in your product information and/or brand story.\nCan retailers shop through these tags?\nYes! Retailers are able to select tags in their filters when shopping, to help them find products that align with their values and commitments. Using tags can therefore help your brand build relations with retailers who share similar commitment values through your products.\nDoes Faire enforce the accuracy of these tags?\nAll brands are able to self-select any tags they feel are relevant to their business. That said, retailers on Faire can open a dispute if they feel like a brand is making misleading statements or claims about their brand or products. Our team investigates any and all retailer disputes to ensure the best level of quality and transparency on the Faire platform.\nFaire reserves the right to carry out spot checks by requesting supporting documentation for the use of the following tags: Organic, Gives back, Handmade, Eco-friendly.\nCan I set these tags on a product level instead?\nNot at this time. These tags are only available at the brand level. We recommend being as detailed as possible in your product descriptions.\nTo learn more about editing your products, visit How to make your products stand out.\n."}

The goal is also to help brands limit where their products are sold, out of respect to existing stockists. If a brand decides to opt-out of Faire Protection, retailers may find their products in other nearby retail locations.\nPlease note: Faire protection is only available to U.S. and Canadian retailers, and only brick and mortar retailers are eligible for Faire protection. Faire protection will not apply to online or pop-up stores.\nHow it works\nBrands are automatically enrolled in Faire Protection unless they request to opt-out. Once set, the first retailer to place an order with the brand will have a 90-day exclusivity for the zip/postal code where their shop is located. Exclusivity starts when the order is placed, and the 90 day clock starts when the order is confirmed.\nFor example, if a retailer just placed an order with a Faire Protected brand, and another retailer in the same zip/postal code tries to place an order with the same brand, they will receive the Faire Protection message shown below. This message indicates that they are blocked from ordering. After 90 days, if the Faire Protected retailer does not reorder from the brand, they give up their Faire Protection and another retailer will then be able to place an order.\nIf your order is canceled, or you return an entire order, your Faire Protection will end automatically. You can renew it by placing another order with the brand.\nPlease note: Faire Protection only applies to orders placed on Faire. We cannot guarantee exclusivity in zip codes beyond purchases placed on our site.\nWhy are retailers from the same zip/postal code able to place orders with my brand?\nWhile Faire Protection allows retailers to lock in exclusivity in their zip/postal code with your brand, there may be times when another retailer will be able to order from you as well. Retailers that have a relationship with a brand from before Faire are still allowed to order with that brand. This could happen if, for example, the retailer referred the brand through our referral program, or the retailer joined Faire with an invitation from the brand, through Faire Direct.\nHave questions?

Use concise and detailed product titles that accurately describe the product you are selling. Include any unique characteristics about the product that you think retailers would want to see before clicking on it.\nMake sure product names are between 35-50 characters with proper spelling and no unrelated keywords\nFor example: Leather Trifold Men\u2019s Wallet - Tan is a better title than Mans wallet - holds everything. look stylish\nInclude keywords like color, style name, and descriptive features\nFor example: French Vanilla Votive Candles is a better title than Vanilla Candles.\nEnsure proper title casing for product names; avoid all lowercase or all uppercase\nFor example: Lavender Patchouli Perfume Roller is a better title than LAVENDER PATCHOULI PERFUME ROLLER or lavender patchouli perfume roller\nAvoid using the product\u2019s SKU as the product name\nFor example: Cashmere Crew Neck Sweater is a better title than SWE12CN\nHere\u2019s your chance to go into detail about what makes your products special. Provide a thorough description of the product that includes all of the relevant information that a retailer would want to know before purchasing.

We will prompt retailers to share feedback about the samples they received from you. We trust these insights will be helpful in growing your sales.\nHow do I ensure no VAT is applied to my samples?\nSamples are not subject to VAT. To ensure your shipment is considered a sample, it is important you:\nClearly label your sample as \"Sample, not for sale\"\nEnsure samples are sent in small/reasonable quantities\nVerify samples are not in a form that would allow for them to be onward sold\nThis will ensure no VAT is applied.

If your brand does not have a market promotion set, your brand will not be considered as participating and will not be included in the Market directory.\nWhat if I already have a shop-wide promotion scheduled during the market dates?\nIf you had a shop-wide percent-off promotion scheduled to run during the market dates of July 17-20 prior to June 13, this promotion will automatically be converted to a market promotion, and your brand will be considered as participating in the market.\nIf you do not wish to participate in the market, you can simply deactivate the market promotion and you will be removed from the list of participating brands.\nIf you choose not to participate in the market, your brand will still be visible and searchable everywhere it currently is on Faire.\nYou can verify your market participation status from the Event Guide within your brand portal.\nHow promotion matching works at Faire Market\nFaire will match your discount up to 5% for eligible orders placed during the market dates.

These promotion types alone won\u2019t qualify you as a participant in the market.\nPromotions provided to retailers via the Invoicing tool or via the Faire Direct App will not be matched.\nThe discount value for the market promotion must be at least 1% and the qualifying amount must be greater than or equal to your shop\u2019s first order minimum value.\nWill market promotions apply to products that I\u2019m running a product-specific promotion on?

Try to avoid direct eye contact in your feature image, and instead consider cropping in tighter on the product you're selling.When is eye contact okay?

This will help balance the product value / shipping cost ratio. \nWe have noticed brands selling heavy and bulky products that have a low to medium price point focus their targeting on more local markets, as the shipping costs associated with selling this type of product internationally does not always allow for margin.\nWhen using Ship with Faire, Faire will be the account holder in relation to the carrier, but you are still the exporter of record. The guidelines and responsibilities detailed in this article still apply."}

If the retailer\u2019s country allows for the reverse charge mechanism, Faire will not collect any VAT on the order and indicate on the invoice that no VAT was collected due to reverse charge.

{"source": "https://www.faire.com/support/articles/5930329425947", "title": "How does Faire calculate VAT for non-VAT registered retailers in another EU member state?", "text": "Brands operating on the Faire platform may make sales to both VAT (value-added tax) registered and non-VAT registered retailers. If an EU located brand is supplying goods to a retailer in another EU country, and the retailer is not registered for VAT, the transaction is deemed to be a B2C (business-to-consumer) transaction for EU VAT purposes. This is classified as a distance sale and the brand is required to charge VAT on the sale.\nDistance sales\nAs of July 1, 2021, EU brands that have distance sales of EUR10,000 or more are required to collect VAT based on the VAT rate in the country where the retailer is located. Prior to July 1, 2021, each EU country had its own threshold that applied to sales to non-VAT registered businesses in that country. You can read more about these changes in Articles 33 and 59c (1) (c) of the EU VAT Directive.\nThe local VAT that is collected must be remitted by the brand to the local tax authorities through an optional special registration scheme called the OSS (Union One Stop Shop) Scheme. If this optional scheme is not followed a local VAT registration will be required in each EU member state to which B2C supplies are made to retailers.\nBrands that do not meet the EUR10,000 threshold may elect to opt into the OSS Scheme and collect VAT based on the applicable rates where the retailer is located.\nHow does Faire calculate VAT on distance sales?\nAs a B2B (business-to-business) platform, the majority of brands on Faire exceed or are expected to exceed the EUR10,000 threshold. Therefore Faire assumes that all brands are registered for the OSS scheme and are required to collect VAT based on the \u201cship to\u201d location for orders with non-VAT registered retailers in other EU member states. For sales to non-VAT registered retailers in other EU member states, Faire applies VAT at the standard rate applicable in the retailer\u2019s country.

Prior to July 1, 2021, each EU country had its own threshold that applied to sales to non-VAT registered businesses in that country. You can read more about these changes in Articles 33 and 59c (1) (c) of the EU VAT Directive. The local VAT that is collected must be remitted by the brand to the local tax authorities through an optional special registration scheme called the OSS (Union One Stop Shop) Scheme. If this optional scheme is not followed a local VAT registration will be required in each EU member state to which B2C supplies are made to retailers. Brands that do not meet the EUR10,000 threshold may elect to opt into the OSS Scheme and collect VAT based on the applicable rates where the retailer is located.

Faire will facilitate this charge and its remittance to brands under certain circumstances, as explained below.\nPlease note: VAT laws differ for business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C) relationships. All transactions on Faire are B2B transactions. If you have any questions about how to facilitate direct to consumer orders not on Faire, we suggest contacting an advisor to assist with those transactions or the marketplace you are conducting business through.\nDo I need to register my business for VAT?\nBrands outside of the European country they are transacting with are required to obtain VAT registration for B2B transactions if at least one of the following criteria is met:\nBrand has business entity in the European country they are selling to\nBrand has fulfillment logistics within the European country they are selling to (ie. warehouse or fulfillment center where you will ship orders from)\nBrand plans to ship products to themselves within the European country before fulfilling to their European retailers\nIf none of the above criteria is met, you do not need to be VAT registered for B2B transactions in that specific country.

Retailers will be responsible for paying VAT at the border when collecting the goods in addition to any duty. Retailers will be notified of this requirement during checkout.\nIn these cases, VAT charges will not be remitted to the brand regardless of whether or not the brand is VAT registered.

In addition to crafting personalized, quality content, consider the audience you are reaching out to, and make sure that the communications you\u2019re sending are not unwanted or unwarranted. It\u2019s essential that you are only reaching out to legitimate business email addresses that have given consent to be contacted by your brand.\nHere are some helpful guidelines to follow:\nReview lists before uploading to Faire or emailing a list of individuals:\nMake sure that the communication is relevant to them (e.g., they are a retailer, they are still in business, you have an existing business relationship with them or have interacted with them before, or\u2013\u2013in the case of new leads\u2013\u2013you don\u2019t have any reason to believe they wouldn\u2019t want to hear from you).\nNever upload purchased or scraped email lists as these tend to include email addresses designed to catch spam senders. This will negatively impact your campaign performance, and in some cases may result in temporary or permanent email privilege suspension. This is also strictly prohibited in regions that adhere to GDPR compliance, and is enforced by our email delivery service. If you are suspended or banned, it is at the discretion of our third-party email delivery service and not in Faire\u2019s control.\nCompare the list you are providing to Faire Direct against your own \u201cunsubscribe\u201d list to make sure the retailers you are reaching out to through Faire haven\u2019t already asked you not to contact them.\nPurge any irrelevant data (or unsubscribed email addresses) from the list before uploading to your Customers list.\nWhen uploading CSVs, only provide the data requested\u2013\u2013name, email address, and store name (optional).\nYour Customers list is able to maintain up to 250,000 customers. After you reach 250k, if you would like to upload additional new customers, you will be prompted to remove any old or inactive emails.\nWe use a third-party email delivery service to send out your invite emails, marketing campaigns, and automation emails. Please note that our email delivery service monitors your email delivery rates for high bounce and spam reports. This is why it is very important to ensure you are only emailing legitimate, vetted contact lists, as your email marketing tools may be blocked if any spam or bounce policies are violated.

When retailers order through the widget, they will receive benefits such as 60-day payment terms and free returns on first orders at 0% commission to you.\nAdding the Faire Direct widget to your website allows you to:\nDrive wholesale orders by making it easier for your customers to find your shop on Faire with a simple click of a button\nPay 0% commission on orders from wholesale customers that buy through the widget\nPlus, the more orders you get through the widget, the better you rank and more retailers will see you in the marketplace\nHow to add a widget\nYou can create and manage a widget by going to the Widget tab in the Marketing section of your portal. This Widget tab allows you to create a widget, set up an ordering button, and view widget performance stats (views, clicks, sign ups, orders, etc.) once retailers begin using your widget.\nTo embed a widget, decide whether you\u2019d like to feature a small, medium, or large sized widget on your website. Once you\u2019ve selected your widget size, you can choose if you\u2019d like to embed the widget on your own, or email our instructions and code to your developer.\nThe widget sizes are as follows:\nSmall 360 x 64px\nStandard 500 x 600px\nLarge 900 x 600px. The large sized widget includes the feature image of your shop on Faire. You can change your feature image at any time within your Marketplace>Shop Page tab in the portal\nHow to embed the new Faire Direct widget\nWe have released three refreshed Faire Direct widget designs and sizes as described above. We are unable to automatically update existing embedded widgets, which means that many brands may currently have the prior widget designs embedded in their website. Not to worry - if you are still using the prior widget designs, they will still function as normal, and you will still receive the full widget analytics in your portal. However, we do recommend updating the widget to one of the new designs as we have seen better retailer feedback and action on them.\nHere\u2019s how to make the switch to the refreshed widget on your website:\nOpen up the Faire Direct widget section in your brand portal by going to Marketing>Widget in your portal\nChoose which widget size you would like to embed (large, standard, or small) from the Available sizes section\nOnce you have settled on a widget size, select the black Copy Code button to copy the HTML\nOpen your website builder up, delete the current embedded widget HTML, and paste the new HTML to embed the new widget\nGo to your website to verify that the new Faire Direct widget has been embedded\nAfter you\u2019ve embedded the new widget, you\u2019ll be able to view any new analytics as soon as a retailer clicks on your new widget for the first time. Additionally, for a short period of time, we will continue to display the analytics from your prior widget in your portal for reference.\nPlease note that once you have updated the widget on your website from the prior design to a new one, you are unable to change it back.\nWidget troubleshooting resources\nAre you using a website builder? If so, we've compiled a list of useful resources to help you resolve any technical issues you may be experiencing.\nTo learn more, feel free to select the builder that is relevant for you:\nShopify\nSquarespace\nWooCommerce/Wordpress\nWix\nBigCommerce\nPlease note, if you have WYSIWYG editor enabled, then you may need to disable the WYSIWYG editor to paste HTML, then re-enable WYSIWYG editor after HTML is pasted. See more details here.\nWidget FAQs\nI already have a wholesale website, can this work for me?\nYou can still use a Faire widget if you have an existing wholesale portal. We have many brands using Faire alongside other wholesale ordering options.

Please see below to learn more about how we will manage domestic and international shipments.\nDomestic UK orders:\nFor any products that brands send from within the UK to a UK-based retailer, Faire will charge the retailer VAT at checkout for the transaction. This amount will then be automatically remitted to the brand in their order payout, where required. In the event that a retailer is purchasing from a non VAT-registered brand based in the UK, we will not charge the retailer any VAT on the transaction.\nInternational orders:\nFor VAT registered retailers, import VAT should not be charged at the border, as it should instead be reported in your VAT return via a process known as postponed accounting. Postponed accounting was introduced in the UK from 1 January 2021, and it allows importers, whose VAT registration numbers are included on the relevant import declaration and who intend on using the imported goods for their business, to account for import VAT via their VAT return (instead of at the time of import).\nFor non VAT registered retailers placing orders of less than \u00a3135, any applicable UK VAT will be charged at checkout. In this situation, UK marketplace rules apply, and VAT will be charged at checkout by Faire to the retailer.\nFor non VAT registered retailers placing orders of more than \u00a3135, import VAT and duties will be charged at the border when importing your products.\n"}

The VAT number that you enter on Faire should be valid for cross-border transactions in the EU by the VAT Information Exchange System (VIES).\nUse this tool to check if your VAT number is VIES validated.\nThere are 3 different types of orders you may place on Faire:\nDomestic ordersWhen a brand in one EU member state ships goods to a retailer in the same EU member state. Ex: A brand ships goods from the Netherlands to a retailer in the Netherlands.\nIntra-community ordersWhen a brand in one EU member state ships goods to a retailer in another EU member state. For a full list of EU member states, check this article on the European Union\u2019s official website.

The standard VAT rate of your country will be added to your invoice.\nIf the brand is located in another EU country, but is shipping the products from the same country as you, then we will check to see if your country allows a reverse charge. If so, we will not collect any VAT on the order and indicate on your invoice that no VAT was collected due to reverse charge.\nYou and the brand you have ordered from will then be responsible to complete the reverse charge on the VAT invoice. If your country doesn\u2019t allow for the reverse charge mechanism, we will collect VAT at checkout and remit this VAT to the brand as part of the brand\u2019s order payout.\nIntra-community orders\nWith intra-community supply, we will not facilitate any VAT charges for VAT registered retailers. We\u2019ll note on the invoice that the order is considered intra-community supply, for your records. You are then responsible for accounting for this transaction on your returns.\nIf you are not VAT registered, we will charge the VAT rate in your country.\nInternational orders\nFor any products that a brand ships from outside the EU, VAT will not be charged at checkout. Any applicable VAT will be charged at the border when importing your products.\nIf you\u2019re a VAT-registered retailer, you can reclaim import VAT the same way you reclaim VAT for domestic orders.\nFor more information on VAT implications for your business, visit Importing to Europe and consult your tax advisor.\nInternational ordersWhen a brand outside of the EU ships goods to a retailer in an EU member state.\nEx: A brand ships goods from the U.S. to a retailer in the Netherlands.\nEx: A brand ships goods from India to a retailer in the Netherlands.\nEx: A brand ships goods from the U.K. to a retailer in the Netherlands (the U.K. is no longer an EU member state due to Brexit)."}

Each metric percentage is calculated from your order and account history within the last 90 days:\nLate shipments\nCanceled orders\nMissing items\nDamaged items\nLate replies\nWithin each metric card you\u2019ll see your metric score, a metric score goal, and context on how you've performed against these goals over the last 90 days.\nGreen status (checkmark): On track\nYellow status (caution symbol): Room to improve\nRed status (exclamation point): Needs improvement\nWe\u2019ve included data on late shipments because we\u2019ve seen that on-time shipping can encourage customers to place more orders with you. The late shipment value you see in your portal shows the % of orders that are shipped after the expected ship date, or the scheduled ship date. In most cases, the expected ship date is calculated by the date the order is sent to you + your shop\u2019s lead time on the date the order was placed. This is different from the estimated ship date which is the date that you enter when accepting the order, or when you split an order. Lead time in this calculation is based on business days, not including weekends and regional holidays.\nFor available-to-ship orders, the expected ship date is used regardless of any subsequent order changes, or updates to the estimated ship date.\nFor scheduled orders, preorders, and backorders, the scheduled ship date will be used to calculate this metric.\nFor split orders, the estimated ship date that you enter when creating the split order will be used. After the order is split, you may change the estimated ship date once after it is set. If you change your ship date more than once we will continue to use the date provided in the first change.\nWhen is an order considered to be a late shipment?\nAvailable to Ship orders are considered late if the order closes as shipped 1+ business days after the expected ship date.\nScheduled orders and preorders are considered late if the order closes as shipped 1+business days after the scheduled ship date. If the scheduled ship date includes a date window, the latest date in the window will be considered the scheduled ship date.\nSplit orders are considered late if the order closes as shipped 1+ business days after the scheduled ship date.

Providing excellent customer service to your buyers will give them more confidence reordering from you and help grow your overall sales on Faire. While your performance on these order fulfillment metrics can influence retailers\u2019 reordering decisions, they are not currently visible to retailers. We\u2019ve included 5 metrics in this section to give you more insight into the service you\u2019re providing to your customers. Each metric percentage is calculated from your order and account history within the last 90 days: Late shipments Canceled orders Missing items Damaged items Late replies Within each metric card you\u2019ll see your metric score, a metric score goal, and context on how you've performed against these goals over the last 90 days. \nGreen status (checkmark): On track \nYellow status (caution symbol): Room to improve \nRed status (exclamation point): Needs improvement   We\u2019ve included data on late shipments because we\u2019ve seen that on-time shipping can encourage customers to place more orders with you. The late shipment value you see in your portal shows the % of orders that are shipped after the expected ship date, or the scheduled ship date. In most cases, the expected ship date is calculated by the date the order is sent to you + your shop\u2019s lead time on the date the order was placed. This is different from the estimated ship date which is the date that you enter when accepting the order, or when you split an order. Lead time in this calculation is based on business days, not including weekends and regional holidays. For available-to-ship orders, the expected ship date is used regardless of any subsequent order changes, or updates to the estimated ship date. For scheduled orders, preorders, and backorders, the scheduled ship date will be used to calculate this metric. For split orders, the estimated ship date that you enter when creating the split order will be used. After the order is split, you may change the estimated ship date once after it is set. If you change your ship date more than once we will continue to use the date provided in the first change. When is an order considered to be a late shipment? \nAvailable to Ship orders are considered late if the order closes as shipped 1+ business days after the expected ship date. \nScheduled orders and preorders are considered late if the order closes as shipped 1+business days after the scheduled ship date. If the scheduled ship date includes a date window, the latest date in the window will be considered the scheduled ship date. \nSplit orders are considered late if the order closes as shipped 1+ business days after the scheduled ship date. The scheduled ship date for split orders is the date you set when the order is split. \nMultiple shipment orders are considered late if the final package for the order is shipped 1+ business days after the scheduled ship date. \nBackorders are considered late if the order closes as shipped 1+ business days after the set restock date.

This will automatically notify the retailer that their order is processing.\nTo cancel the order: Click the \"Cancel Order\" button on the right hand side of the order page. This will automatically notify the retailer that their order has been canceled and will not be fulfilled.\nOnce an order has been accepted and is pending fulfillment, the order will display as unfulfilled on the orders tab. From the order fulfillment page, shipment options will become available. Once you enter tracking information for the order will be marked as \"fulfilled\u201d.\nOnce tracking information has been entered for the order, the order will display as Fulfilled.\nPlease note: Order payouts will be initiated once the package has been scanned by your shipping carrier and the items are in transit. This also helps us ensure that retailers are receiving accurate ship date notifications.

When this happens, you will notice that these payouts are grayed out and an estimated future payout date is provided.\nFor some preorders, you will notice the Payout date and Ship date are grayed out with an Unknown field. This is because these fields won't be solidified until the preorder is fully fulfilled.\nHow are the payouts organized on the Payouts page?\nPayouts are automatically sorted by the payout date, with the most recent transactions or future payouts listed first. If you prefer to view payouts in ascending order, you can adjust this by clicking the \u201cPayout Date\u201d header on the Payouts page. You can also choose to sort by ship date in ascending or descending order by clicking the \u201cShip Date\u201d header.\nFilters that you can use:\nThe filters at the top of the Payouts page enable you to quickly filter the payouts data that you are viewing.

All payouts associated with the order number or customer will be surfaced in the results.\nCSV payouts export\nWe provide a downloadable CSV from the Payouts page.\nYou can export this report by clicking the \u201cExport\u201d button in the top right corner of your Payouts page. You will be prompted to select the time period that you would like to pull information for.\nFeel free to select the \u201cCustom\u201d option from the drop down if you don\u2019t see a preset option that works for you.\nWhat information is available in the CSV payouts export?\nThe report includes relevant information (if applicable) such as:\nPayout Amount\nType\nOrder Number\nRetailer Name\nOrder Date\nOrder Total ($)\nDamaged Or Missing ($)\nPromotion\nPromotions ($)\nCommission (%)\nCommission ($)\nPlacement Fee ($)\nTaxes ($)\nShipping Costs ($)\nACH Next Day Fee (%)\nACH Next Day Fee ($)\nInsider Free Shipping\nInsider Shipping Charge ($)\nHow can I match up my payouts with my bank statements using the order number?\nWe understand that many of our brands reconcile their payouts from Faire directly against their bank statements. For this reason, we added the order number to the ACH transaction descriptions. This makes it easier for you to line up transactions in your bank statement with payouts that you see in your Payouts page or CSV payouts export.\nUnfortunately, not all banks display the ACH description information in the same way, and some may not display it at all. This means that you may need to explore a few different bank statement views to be able to see this information. Here are some places you can look:\nA downloaded PDF or CSV bank statement: This is the best source for the ACH description information. We\u2019ve noticed that banks often do include the ACH description details in a statement export.\nA detailed payment summary via mobile or website: We've noticed that some banks do offer a clickable \"View more details\" option for each payment listed in their bank statement summary view. Often the ACH description can be found within these payment details if they are offered.\nA statement summary via bank website (via computer): We've noticed that some banks do include the ACH descriptions in the bank statement summary view when it's accessed via the web (Chase does this).\nA statement summary via a mobile bank application: From what we've seen it's very unlikely that you will see the ACH description in your normal statement view within their mobile web application.\nAs mentioned, it is possible that your bank doesn\u2019t surface this information in any of the above. Sadly, we don\u2019t have control over how individual banks surface these details, we are very sorry if you aren\u2019t able to access this information! We are continuing to explore how we might be able to better place this information so it is available to more people."}

For this reason, we added the order number to the ACH transaction descriptions. This makes it easier for you to line up transactions in your bank statement with payouts that you see in your Payouts page or CSV payouts export.\nUnfortunately, not all banks display the ACH description information in the same way, and some may not display it at all. This means that you may need to explore a few different bank statement views to be able to see this information. Here are some places you can look:\n\nA downloaded PDF or CSV bank statement: This is the best source for the ACH description information. We\u2019ve noticed that banks often do include the ACH description details in a statement export.\n\nA detailed payment summary via mobile or website: We've noticed that some banks do offer a clickable \"View more details\" option for each payment listed in their bank statement summary view. Often the ACH description can be found within these payment details if they are offered.\n\nA statement summary via bank website (via computer): We've noticed that some banks do include the ACH descriptions in the bank statement summary view when it's accessed via the web (Chase does this).\n\nA statement summary via a mobile bank application: From what we've seen it's very unlikely that you will see the ACH description in your normal statement view within their mobile web application.\nAs mentioned, it is possible that your bank doesn\u2019t surface this information in any of the above. Sadly, we don\u2019t have control over how individual banks surface these details, we are very sorry if you aren\u2019t able to access this information!

We also recommend using this column alongside the Amount in Cart column to see who\u2019s actively considering placing another order. \nRelationship: This column will show your relationship to the customer.If the customer has ordered with you on Faire, the relationship will be labeled \u201cCustomer\u201d.If the customer hasn't ordered with you on Faire yet, the relationship will be \u201cLead\u201d. \nReview submitted: This data column will show you which of your customers have left a review for your brand. You can use this data to send an email prompting customers to leave a review for your brand if they haven\u2019t. Retailers can leave a review for your brand for up to 90 days after their order has closed as delivered. \nSource: This column indicates how the retailer was added to your customers list. This can include:\n\nFaire Direct app\nFaire Direct Link\nFaire Direct widget\nInvoice\nMailchimp import\nManual Upload\nMarketplace\n\n \nStore Type: This column shows you the type of store the customer has. \nTotal Orders (formerly Order Count): This column helps you quickly identify the number of orders a customer has already placed with you.

The program is not currently available to brands new to Faire, but we expect the experience to be available in Q4 2022. We look forward to monitoring this feature and incorporating feedback from our community as we expand it in the future.\nHow can I qualify as a Top Shop?\nTop Shop is a quarterly rewards program, and there are 4 criteria you must meet by the end of each quarter to unlock rewards for the following quarter. On the last day of each quarter, your eligibility will be calculated based on whether you meet the following criteria:\nEarn at least 60 points towards your merchandising score.\nMaintain an average rating of 4.5 stars or higher.\nReceive reorders from your existing active retailers during the qualification quarter to meet your marketplace category\u2019s Reorder Rate threshold.\nFulfill 70% of your orders perfectly.

If you don\u2019t meet the criteria in a given quarter, don't worry! Each quarter you\u2019ll have the opportunity to meet the 4 criteria to achieve Top Shop status.\nThe checkpoint schedule is:\nJanuary 1-March 31\nApril 1-June 30\nJuly 1-September 30\nOctober 1-December 31\nEach checkpoint cutoff is at 11:59:59pm PST on the above quarter end dates.\nMore about the program criteria\nEach action you can take to qualify as a Top Shop is an action that will help you grow your business on Faire! We studied the attributes of top performers to determine the most important criteria for providing an exceptional customer experience and growing your business on Faire.\nVisit the Top Shop page within your brand portal for specific tips on how to meet each criteria listed below.\nMerchandising ScoreYou must earn at least 60 points to meet this criteria. We calculate your merchandising score by adding up the points that you earn by taking the actions listed below. You do not need to take all of the actions below to earn 60 points. You can choose which actions make the most sense for your business.\n[30 points] Run at least 1 promotion\nThe promotion must be active during the current qualification quarter dates to be counted towards your Merchandising Score for that quarter.Product-specific and shop-wide promotions qualify, but custom promo codes do not\n[20 points] Add new products to your catalog\nThe new products that are added to your catalog, must be published and in-stock to be counted towards your Merchandising Score.\n[20 points] Meet your category's threshold for number of active products.You can see your brand\u2019s category threshold in your Top Shop page.\nFor a product to be considered active, the product must be published and in-stock in your shop.\n[10 points] Set your first order minimum to $200 or lower\n[10 points] Add an average of 4 videos or images per product listing\nYour product listing does not need to have 4 videos and 4 images, we add the number of images and videos together for each product listing and determine your catalog average from there. For example, your product listings could have 3 images and 1 video to meet this criteria.\n[10 points] Write an average of 300 characters per product description\nTo easily determine which of your product descriptions do not have 300 characters, you can export your list of active products from your Faire account, and review your product descriptions using that data export.\nRetailer RatingYou must have a retailer rating of at least 4.5 stars to meet this criteria. On the last day of the qualification quarter, we check the average rating of all the retailer review ratings your shop has ever received on Faire. If your average rating is at least 4.5 stars at this check point, you will meet this criteria!\nReorder RateYou must meet the Reorder Rate % threshold for your brand\u2019s marketplace category in order to meet this criteria. Reorder Rate refers to the % of your existing active retailers that reorder from you during the qualification quarter. At the beginning of each quarter, we calculate how many retailers have ever ordered from you on Faire prior to the start date of the quarter. The calculation will only include existing active retailers. Retailers that are inactive or out of business will be excluded from this total.\nAn existing retailer is a retailer that has ordered with your brand on Faire before the starting date of the current qualification quarter.\nAn active retailer is a retailer that has ordered with any brand on Faire within the last year from the starting date of the current qualification quarter.\nYour Reorder Rate is calculated based on the number of existing active retailers that reorder with you during the qualification quarter, not the total number of orders you receive that are reorders.\nIf a retailer orders with your brand for the first time and reorders during the qualification quarter, this retailer will not be counted towards your Reorder Rate for the quarter. This is because the retailer is not an existing retailer, as they did not order with your brand before the start of the qualification quarter are not eligible to be counted for this quarter.\nHow can I calculate how many retailers I need to reorder this quarter to meet my Reorder Rate % threshold from my Faire account?\nYou can find a close estimate of how many retailers you\u2019ll need to reorder from you during the qualification quarter by using the data available in the CRM, Customer Relationship Manager, the Customers page, in your Faire account.\nNavigate to your Customers page and click in to view the list of retailers that have ever Ordered with your brand on Faire. In this example, we see 536.\nThen we can apply a Last Ordered filter to see how many retailers have ordered with you during the current qualification quarter. After we apply the filter, we see in this example 126 retailers have ordered so far this quarter.\nAfter that, we want to see how many of those retailers ordered with you for the first time during this quarter to find which of those retailers are new retailers to your shop. New retailers are excluded from your total number of existing active retailers that your Reorder Rate % is calculated from. To do that, we\u2019ll add a Total orders filter of Greater than 1.This may not be perfect because a retailer could have ordered with you for the first time and reordered during this quarter (order count greater than 1 but is not an existing retailer to count towards Reorder Rate), so this filter would not exclude a retailer with that scenario.After applying the filter, we see that 76 existing retailers have placed an order during this qualification quarter, and those retailers are counted towards your Reorder Rate percentage for this quarter.\nAfter we have all of that data, we can break it down to find your current Reorder Rate like this:\n126 retailers that have ordered with your brand during the current qualification quarter\n76 existing retailers that have ordered with your brand during the current qualification quarter (total order count >1)\n126-76 = 50 New retailers ordered with your brand during the current qualification quarter (total order count <2)\n536 retailers that have ever ordered with your brand on Faire minus 50 new retailers = 486 existing retailers (ordered with your brand before the starting date of the quarter) for this current qualification quarter\n76 existing retailers reordered during the qualification quarter out of a total 486 existing retailers for your brand = 15.6% Reorder Rate.\nWe don\u2019t share a retailer\u2019s full ordering history on Faire with brands, due to our privacy policy, so this calculation will provide an estimate of existing retailers eligible for your Top Shop Reorder Rate, but it does not include which of those retailers are also active (placed an order with any brand on Faire within the last 1 year from the start of the current qualification quarter). Your total number of existing active retailers that your Reorder Rate is calculated from, will never be greater than your total of existing retailers, which this calculation helps you find an estimate for.\nPerfect Order Rate\nTo meet the Perfect Order Rate criteria, brands must fulfill at least 70% of their orders perfectly. An order will be considered a 'perfect order' if all of the following conditions are met:\nThe order is shipped within 3 calendar days of your lead time\nThis timeframe is calculated from the date the order is sent to you, to the date the order closes as Shipped in the system, compared to your shop\u2019s lead time on the date the order was placed.\nThe entered estimated ship date that the brand adds to accept the order, is not considered in this calculation, and will not affect this calculation negatively or positively.\nThe order contains no backordered, out-of-stock, or discontinued products\nThe order is not canceled for a reason within the brand's control\nIf you change your lead time during the qualification quarter it will not affect the \u201cperfect\u201d status of orders you\u2019ve already fulfilled. The new lead time will only be applied to new orders."}

This ensures that our brands get seen by the retailers who are a good match for their products.\nUltimately, the goal of Faire\u2019s search and ranking algorithm is to help retailers find relevant products and increase sales for our brands. We consider over 100 factors to determine how we rank search results. This helps us produce a list of products that is personalized and unique to each retailer. This means that if you search for your own brand or products, your search results will not match what retailers will see when they make the same search. All search results are highly customized and vary a lot for each retailer. For more details, visit Why can\u2019t I find my products on Faire\u2019s search results.\nWhat factors determine how my products are ranked?\nIn this article we will explore some of the key factors that contribute to your brand\u2019s ranking and provide some tips on how to improve your visibility in the marketplace.\nAlso, please note that we\u2019re constantly working to improve our ranking model to ensure we are able to increase our brand\u2019s order volume as well as provide our retailers with recommendations for their next best sellers. In that spirit, we frequently experiment with adding new features, and your products ranking may change. We will keep this article up to date so you have a good reference for any future updates.\nAs mentioned above, there are three categories that contribute to ranking:\nProduct names, descriptions, and categories\nRetailers\u2019 prior activity and engagement\nBrand performance\nWe first match the search terms that retailers use with words used in your product title, description, product type, and category. Exact matches will automatically be prioritized in the ranking, and synonyms or relevant items will be included after exact matches. After identifying the relevant products in the query, we further rank the products based on the following two general categories.\nRetailer\u2019s prior activity and engagement\nOur goal is to help retailers find products that are perfect for their store. To do this, we leverage historical information about our retailers\u2019 activity and engagement on Faire. We consider the retailer\u2019s previous search and purchase history, answers to preference quizzes, navigation behaviors on the site, and even products that similar retailers have purchased.\nThe more likely we think a product is to be added to the retailers cart, the higher we\u2019ll rank it. The search results and recommended items will appear differently to each retailer because their behaviors are unique.\nWe want retailers to have a positive experience when purchasing products on Faire, and so we elevate products from brands that have quality products and a proven track record of responsiveness and great customer support. There are several factors that contribute to a brands\u2019 overall performance, but some of the key things we consider include:\nProduct conversion: When retailers find your products, they often purchase them\nReview rating: Great reviews are submitted by retailers\nReturn rate: Most of the retailers are happy with what they receive and don\u2019t return your products\nOrder cancellations: You fulfill order requests timely and rarely cancel a few from time to time\nOrder fulfillment timing: You often get orders fulfilled quickly with just the occasional delay\nThis being said, we understand that the occasional bad review, order cancellation, or product return is going to happen, and is a normal part of doing business, so a few negative actions have very little impact on your ranking. For these actions, we\u2019re weighting ranking based on broad patterns over weeks and months, not on individual actions.\nHow can I improve my ranking?\nHere are some tips on how you can improve your product ranking on Faire. You'll notice that most of these tips are focused around increasing your product sell through and conversion rate. This is because how your products perform on Faire is the most important factor in determining your product ranking. Please keep this in mind while you explore these tips!\nOpportunities to improve your product and brand ranking\nUse concise and detailed product titles and descriptions as well as tag accurate product types that describe your products. Include any unique characteristics about the product.\nFor example, French Vanilla Votive Candles is a better title than Vanilla Candles\nProvide a detailed description of the product that includes all of the relevant information that you think a retailer would want to know before purchasing. Include key descriptive words and characteristics that you would like to highlight.\nMaintain high-quality pictures that are high resolution and accurately depict your products. This will lead to higher conversion rates, which ultimately contributes to higher ranking.\nOptimize your pricing and run specials to drive more interest to your products.\nMaintain low minimums, bearing in mind two factors:\n- Your profit margin\n- The shipping costs your retailers may get charged\nRetailers will often filter search results by minimum prices, we recommend keeping minimums at $200 or lower for your local customers to ensure your products get the most visibility.\nFor international customers, we recommend setting minimums considering factors such as shipping distance and shipping cost to ensure the best value and experience for retailers.\nYou can set specific order minimums for different countries, by ticking Set specific minimums for countries in your shop settings.\nAdopt Faire Direct tools by utilizing the widget on your website or by sharing your link with existing retail partners. This can increase your sales and conversion on Faire, which can boost your ranking.\nEnsure that your complete catalog of products is listed on Faire. This contributes to a positive retailer experience and can increase your conversion, which can boost your ranking.\nOffer high-quality customer service to your Faire retailers by: getting back to customer inquiries quickly in the Faire Messenger, keeping lead times and delivery times down, working with retailers to resolve negative reviews, keeping order cancellations down, and delivering quality products that arrive as expected.\nDo returns impact my ranking?\nFaire offers returns as a value proposition for our retailers to encourage them to try new products and extend their business to new brands risk free. We understand that brands may have concerns about how these returns impact their overall product ranking in search results. While we do consider historical return rate in our ranking system, this is only one of over 100 factors that we consider in ranking search results. That said, having a few returns will not have a substantial impact on your ranking. Even if a brand's return rate is really high, there\u2019s no guarantee their ranking will drop if other factors improve or make up for it. Generally speaking, having well performing products that sell well will have the most impact on product ranking.\nDo missing or damaged items impact my ranking?\nWe understand that missing and damaged items are sometimes caused by forces outside of the brands control, and so while we do consider missing and damaged items in our ranking algorithm, we\u2019re weighting the ranking based on broad patterns over weeks and months. A few reports of missing or damaged items will not have a substantial impact on your ranking.\nDo order cancellations impact my ranking?\nYes, we do consider order cancellation rates in our ranking system. We understand that cancellations are necessary sometimes, so we weight this factor in our ranking based on broad patterns over weeks and months, not on individual cancellations.\nNote that your cancellation rate doesn\u2019t include orders that are cancelled by retailers; however, it does include cancellations that we initiate for brands. This means that if a brand contacts our team and would like us to cancel an order on their behalf, it will impact this metric.\nHow does my review rating impact my ranking?\nReviews are a great way for you to build your credibility on Faire and attract new retailers to your brand. Our search algorithm rewards brands that maintain a positive review rating, but receiving the occasional bad review won\u2019t significantly hurt your ranking.\nIf you receive a negative review, we encourage you to reach out to the retailer via Faire Messenger with any questions you may have about their experience. If an understanding is reached, the retailer may edit or remove their review, which may help your ranking. Alternatively, you may respond publicly to the review. While doing so won\u2019t directly impact your ranking, it gives you the opportunity to provide more context on any issues or negative information that is being reported by a retailer. This will help inform future potential customers and may help reduce any doubts they have as well as improve their perception of your brand.\nWe also recommend that you follow up with retailers after an order is fulfilled, to request that they leave you a review. This can help boost your review rating, especially if you target retailers that order from you often.\nFor more information about review ratings, check out our Help Center article, Building a positive reputation through reviews.\nWhy don\u2019t I see my products when I navigate to their corresponding category?\nWhen a retailer selects a category, we fetch the top 1000 products within that category, based on text relevance and the retailers\u2019 historical activity and engagement on Faire. This means that all brands may not be listed in the category results, especially for common categories like \u201cwomen\u201d where there are more than 1000 products in the category. This doesn\u2019t mean that your brand\u2019s products are excluded from the category nor are they excluded from all category navigation results. Category navigation results, similar to search results, are highly customized and vary a lot depending on the retailer.\nNote that the same ranking logic is applied to both search results and category navigation results, this means that the tips for improving ranking apply to both. We do recommend that you be as granular as possible when you assign categories to your products by utilizing subcategories, this will help your products get more visibility when retailers search within subcategories.\nDo backorders impact my ranking?\nNo, not directly; however, backorders may indirectly impact your ranking if they lead to negative retailer reviews or lower product conversion rates. We encourage brands to keep their inventory up-to-date to prevent backorders.\nHow does fulfillment timing impact ranking?\nWe want to ensure positive shopping experiences for our retailers, and so order fulfillment timing is considered as a factor in our ranking system. We encourage our brands to quickly fulfill orders when they are able to; however, we know this is not always possible and so a few delayed orders will not have a significant impact on your ranking."}

Also, please note that we\u2019re constantly working to improve our ranking model to ensure we are able to increase our brand\u2019s order volume as well as provide our retailers with recommendations for their next best sellers. In that spirit, we frequently experiment with adding new features, and your products ranking may change. We will keep this article up to date so you have a good reference for any future updates.  As mentioned above, there are three categories that contribute to ranking: Product names, descriptions, and categories Retailers\u2019 prior activity and engagement Brand performance We first match the search terms that retailers use with words used in your product title, description, product type, and category. Exact matches will automatically be prioritized in the ranking, and synonyms or relevant items will be included after exact matches. After identifying the relevant products in the query, we further rank the products based on the following two general categories.  Retailer\u2019s prior activity and engagement Our goal is to help retailers find products that are perfect for their store. To do this, we leverage historical information about our retailers\u2019 activity and engagement on Faire. We consider the retailer\u2019s previous search and purchase history, answers to preference quizzes, navigation behaviors on the site, and even products that similar retailers have purchased.  The more likely we think a product is to be added to the retailers cart, the higher we\u2019ll rank it. The search results and recommended items will appear differently to each retailer because their behaviors are unique.  We want retailers to have a positive experience when purchasing products on Faire, and so we elevate products from brands that have quality products and a proven track record of responsiveness and great customer support. There are several factors that contribute to a brands\u2019 overall performance, but some of the key things we consider include:   \nProduct conversion: When retailers find your products, they often purchase them \nReview rating: Great reviews are submitted by retailers \nReturn rate: Most of the retailers are happy with what they receive and don\u2019t return your products \nOrder cancellations: You fulfill order requests timely and rarely cancel a few from time to time \nOrder fulfillment timing: You often get orders fulfilled quickly with just the occasional delay This being said, we understand that the occasional bad review, order cancellation, or product return is going to happen, and is a normal part of doing business, so a few negative actions have very little impact on your ranking. For these actions, we\u2019re weighting ranking based on broad patterns over weeks and months, not on individual actions.  How can I improve my ranking?"}

This setting will impact both how new products sync from WooCommerce to Faire and how updated information for existing products imported from WooCommerce sync with Faire.\n*Product Duplication:\nPlease note that importing products from WooCommerce may result in the duplication of products if they are already listed on Faire prior to this integration being set up.\nAt this time the product needs to be synced from WooCommerce to sync product/order information between the two platforms. As a potential workaround you could keep the newly imported product active and deactivate your existing Faire product to allow this integration to work seamlessly for you. Please note that deactivating or deleting products will result in the sell-through data and analytics associated with those products being lost.\nDo Not Sync: With this setting enabled, products will not sync automatically, and you\u2019ll have to manually synch products and product information updates\nSync Scheduled: With this setting enabled, new products and product information updates will sync automatically per a scheduled cadence you set\nSync Schedule Every\nIf you select \u2018Sync Scheduled\u2019 as the product sync mode, you can select the sync schedule in this setting.You have the ability to select the time increments in which product information will update, with a minimum time of every 0.5 hours (30 minutes)\nSync on Stock Update\nThis setting allows you to sync product details that are available every time stock/inventory is updated from WooCommerce to Faire.\nYes (checked): Every time there is a stock/inventory update between WooCommerce and Faire, we will automatically sync any product updates available as well.\nNo (un-checked): Product sync will only occur based on the Product Sync Mode enabled above\nWholesale Price as a percentage of retail price (%)\nThis setting allows you to set the wholesale price margin that will be displayed on Faire, based on the direct to consumer price you have in WooCommerce.The minimum percentage is 10% and the maximum is 80%.\nExclude Sync Fields\nThis setting allows you to exclude fields from being overwritten on Faire during the product sync.\nFor example, if you do an import of a product and the SKU from WooCommerce imports to Faire as \u201812345\u2019, but you would like to change that to \u2018faire12345\u2019 on Faire, adding the \u2018variant sku\u2019 to the excluded sync fields will ensure we do not overwrite this change during the next product sync.\nThere is a dropdown that displays all the possible fields to exclude from updating.\n*Please note that any changes made on Faire products will not be carried over to WooCommerce, so there is no risk of that information being overwritten\nManual Sync\nThis button allows you to manually sync products at any time.

This is to ensure that no orders have been placed on Faire for that same item to prevent overselling.\nNo (not checked off): When this setting is off, order sync will run as scheduled in the Order Sync Mode.\nLast Sync ResultsThis will show you a log of:\nHow many orders are queued for the next sync\nOrders successfully synced in the last sync\nProduct Type\nThis allows you to sync any new taxonomy types or changes that have happened on Faire\nProducts in WooCommerce\nProducts in WooCommerce will now have new Faire fields that can be added by you for information needed on Faire products:\nWholesale Price:The wholesale price which will be shown in Faire\nTariff Code: The Tariff code required on this product for any international shipments\nLifecycle State:The state of the product in Faire\nTaxonomy Type: The product type that will be shown in Faire\nPre-order Settings:This allows you to create pro-order products for Faire, and set the applicable dates for the pre-order window\nThe products page will have two new columns related to Faire:\nFaire State: This indicates the state of the product on Faire.

You can also bulk edit the product state here by multi-selecting products.\nFaire Product: Gives you the ability to sync details on a product level using the \u2018sync\u2019 button.\nFaire Orders in WooCommerce\nOnce Faire orders are synced to WooCommerce, there are two main actions you can take on the brand order:\n1. Accept the Faire Order: You can click the \u2018Accept Order\u2019 button on the right side of the order in WooCommerce. This will move the status of the order from \u2018New\u2019 to \u2018Unfulfilled\u2019 in Faire.\nThis section of the order will also indicate that the order is from Faire and the payment status.\n*Please note that at this time this integration does not include the syncing of any payment status information. This means once you are paid out for the order in Faire, this will not update the status on WooCommerce. You will need to manually update this on WooCommerce.\n2. Adding Shipping Details: You can also add shipping details to WooCommerce to sync them over to Faire.\nThe required details are:\nShipping method\nShipping cost\nTracking number\nThe required details are:\nShipping method\nShipping cost\nTracking number"}

Eg) On Faire you have a White T-shirt in a S, M, L, but in WooCommerce you have the White T-shirt in a S. When you link products, and then run a product sync, the M and L variants will be created on the WooCommerce product. 4. I have some variations that exist on the Faire variations that do not exist on WooCommerce and some WooCommerce variations that do not exist on Faire If this is the case, you will run the product linking and it will indicate that a variation needs to be added manually to WooCommerce so the Faire variation can have a link.   To create the variation manually, you will navigate to the product in WooCommerce and create the new variation. You will also see the following message indicating that a manual action is needed.   In the product data on WooCommerce under \u2018Variations\u2019 you will want to add the variation needed.    Once this has been saved, you can expand the newly made variation and add the correct SKU information and link to the correct Faire product as shown below.   Once that is saved, you can sync the product manually from the main products page as shown below.   Once this sync is done, the WooCommerce variation that was not available on Faire will be created on Faire as well.    Faire Integration Settings in WooCommerce"}

If you make changes to your location or currency in Faire, this information will not be automatically updated here, you\u2019ll need to select the Brand Sync button to re-sync this information.    Product Settings Product Sync Mode This setting will control how your products sync from WooCommerce to Faire. This setting will impact both how new products sync from WooCommerce to Faire and how updated information for existing products imported from WooCommerce sync with Faire.  *Product Duplication: Please note that importing products from WooCommerce may result in the duplication of products if they are already listed on Faire prior to this integration being set up.  At this time the product needs to be synced from WooCommerce to sync product/order information between the two platforms. As a potential workaround you could keep the newly imported product active and deactivate your existing Faire product to allow this integration to work seamlessly for you. Please note that deactivating or deleting products will result in the sell-through data and analytics associated with those products being lost. \nDo Not Sync: With this setting enabled, products will not sync automatically, and you\u2019ll have to manually synch products and product information updates  \nSync Scheduled: With this setting enabled, new products and product information updates will sync automatically per a scheduled cadence you set    Sync Schedule Every If you select \u2018Sync Scheduled\u2019 as the product sync mode, you can select the sync schedule in this setting.You have the ability to select the time increments in which product information will update, with a minimum time of every 0.5 hours (30 minutes)   Sync on Stock Update This setting allows you to sync product details that are available every time stock/inventory is updated from WooCommerce to Faire.  \nYes (checked): Every time there is a stock/inventory update between WooCommerce and Faire, we will automatically sync any product updates available as well. \nNo (un-checked): Product sync will only occur based on the Product Sync Mode enabled above   Wholesale Price as a percentage of retail price (%) This setting allows you to set the wholesale price margin that will be displayed on Faire, based on the direct to consumer price you have in WooCommerce.The minimum percentage is 10% and the maximum is 80%.    Exclude Sync Fields This setting allows you to exclude fields from being overwritten on Faire during the product sync. For example, if you do an import of a product and the SKU from WooCommerce imports to Faire as \u201812345\u2019, but you would like to change that to \u2018faire12345\u2019 on Faire, adding the \u2018variant sku\u2019 to the excluded sync fields will ensure we do not overwrite this change during the next product sync. There is a dropdown that displays all the possible fields to exclude from updating. *Please note that any changes made on Faire products will not be carried over to WooCommerce, so there is no risk of that information being overwritten   Manual Sync This button allows you to manually sync products at any time. This is especially helpful if they do not have a scheduled sync on for syncing products over   Last Sync Results This will show you a log of: How many products are queued to sync in the next sync The last product sync that occurred Products successfully synced Any errors that occurred Orders & Inventory Settings Order Sync Mode This setting allows you to select how you would like your orders to sync from Faire to WooCommerce. \nDo Not Sync: With this setting enabled, orders will not sync automatically, and you can choose to manually sync orders individually \nSync Scheduled: With this setting enabled, you can schedule an ongoing order sync to have new orders sync automatically.

This is to ensure that no orders have been placed on Faire for that same item to prevent overselling. \nNo (not checked off): When this setting is off, order sync will run as scheduled in the Order Sync Mode.

Our integration also gives you the ability to import new products directly from Shopify to our platform without submitting your catalog.\nThis article is for integrating with Shopify once your shop is active on Faire. If you want to know more about onboarding with Shopify, please refer to Onboarding with Shopify.\nWhat does the Shopify integration do?\nCurrently, the Shopify integration has three primary functions: inventory sync, order sync, and catalog import:\nInventory sync (Shopify \u2192 Faire) When inventory sync is turned on, inventory counts on Faire will be automatically kept up to date with the counts in Shopify. Your products will be automatically moved in and out of stock on Faire as orders are placed here and in your other channels. This will prevent unwanted backorders and save you time activating and deactivating products on Faire!\nOrder sync (Faire \u2192 Shopify)When order sync is turned on, orders will automatically sync to Shopify once they have been accepted on Faire. This means:\nFaire orders can flow into Shopify and your other system(s) without you having to manually key each of them in.\nInventory can be automatically deducted in your other system(s) based on Faire orders.\nCatalog import (Shopify \u2192 Faire)This gives you the ability to import selected products from Shopify directly to Faire\nOur integration does not fully support preorders and prepacks.

If you need assistance updating prepack listings, reach out to integrations.support@faire.com. Syncing fulfillment information and continuous catalog syncs are currently not supported.\nWhat should I do before setting up the Shopify integration?\nEnsure the SKUs entered for your products on Faire line up with the SKUs used in your Shopify store. If you haven\u2019t entered SKUs on Faire, this is a great time to do so! It will ensure a seamless and easy integration experience.\nHow do I set up the Shopify integration?\nGo to your Integrations tab\nClick Get Started to begin the setup process\nEnter your Shopify store prefix and click Connect\nThe last part of your URL (\u201c.myshopify.com\u201d) is automatically filled in for you, so you just need to enter the first portion\nIf you connect the wrong Shopify account, follow either of the steps below:\nDisconnect the app from the Shopify side, restart this process, and type in the correct store\nClick through the flow, do not turn on inventory or order sync, then disconnect the app from the Faire side here\nIf you connect the wrong Shopify account, follow either of the steps below:\nDisconnect the app from the Shopify side, restart this process, and type in the correct store\nClick through the flow, do not turn on inventory or order sync, then disconnect the app from the Faire side here\nYou will be taken to your Shopify Admin portal where you will be asked to enable the Faire integration\nOnce you enable the integration in your Shopify Admin portal, you will be automatically redirected back to Faire. Begin matching your Faire products with the corresponding Shopify items. This is the foundation for the entire integration and is required for order and inventory sync to work properly. For matching products you have two options:\n[Recommended] Match automatically: We will automatically match as many of your Faire and Shopify products as possible by comparing their SKUs. Afterward, you will have a chance to review the matches we made, adjust them yourself if you\u2019d like, and fill in any gaps that we missed.\nMatch products myself: If you select this option, you will have to manually match each of your Faire products to the corresponding listing on Shopify.\nThis step is only applicable to products added prior to setting up the integration.\nIf you choose automatic product matching, it will take a few minutes to match as many products as possible for you. Once that is completed, you will be taken to the screen below, which will let you know how many matches were made automatically and how many items you will need to review. To proceed, click Review Matches.\nWhen reviewing and manually matching products, you will see the Faire products are listed in the left column. Next to each is a search box where you can select which Shopify listing it matches up with. You can search for a Shopify product based on the name of the product or its SKU. If there is no corresponding listing on Shopify, or if you deliberately don\u2019t want to link the product, click Don\u2019t Link.\nThere are three possible options for each product:\nMatched: This product has been successfully linked with a Shopify product\n\nIntentionally unmatched: This product has deliberately not been linked with a product in Shopify\nNo preference specified: This product has not yet been linked with a Shopify product or marked as intentionally unlinked\nOnce you have matched your products to the best of your ability, click Confirm & Finish to proceed.

Once toggled on:\nYou will now see the configurations needed in order to enable this feature.\nPricing: You will need to confirm whether the price located in Shopify is a retail price or wholesale price.\nPricing Calculation: You need to let us know what to set your wholesale/retail price to based on your selection in step 1.*\nThis will be applied for all pricing syncs going forward.\n*If you do not use a standard margin on all prices, you will have the option to change these prices on a product level in your Faire product editor.\nPrices will be updated on Faire when an update is made to the main price on Shopify. If an update is made to a price in another currency on Shopify, that price will only be pulled over when a price change is detected on the main Shopify price, or an inventory change is detected on Shopify and inventory syncing is enabled in the integration.\nInventory Locations: Inventory syncing allows you to sync your Shopify inventory with Faire based on your inventory locations. Once toggled on you will have the option to select which locations inventory is pulled from in Shopify by clicking 'manage locations'. This setting will default to using all locations.\nDeducting Inventory for Testers: This will determine whether or not inventory is deducted for any testers that have been sold on a Faire order\nOrder Payment Status: This dropdown will give you the ability to select the payment status that will be displayed on your Faire orders in Shopify\nCommission: This setting will determine how commission will be communicated on Faire orders in Shopify\nOrder Tags: This setting gives you the ability to freehand any tags you\u2019d like to be added to Faire orders when they are synced to Shopify\nOrder Name: With this setting, you can select whether the Shopify order name will contain the Faire order number or the Shopify order number.\nPrice Sync: Price syncing will allow you to keep prices on Faire automatically up to date with the prices available in Shopify.

If an update is made to a price in another currency on Shopify, that price will only be pulled over when a price change is detected on the main Shopify price, or an inventory change is detected on Shopify and inventory syncing is enabled in the integration.\nHow does inventory syncing work?\nIf you track inventory counts in Shopify, we will automatically keep your inventory counts on Faire in sync.\nAs customers purchase your products elsewhere and your inventory counts on Shopify are reduced, we will update your inventory counts on Faire accordingly.\nThe inventory sync component of the integration only ensures inventory changes in Shopify get reflected on Faire, not the other way around. If you want inventory levels in Shopify and your other system(s) to update every time a Faire order is placed, you will also need to utilize the order sync component of this integration.\nInventory syncing allows you to sync your Shopify inventory with Faire based on your inventory locations. You can find this in the 'settings' section of your Shopify Integration.\nto learn more about inventory tracking, visit Setting my product inventory levels.\nHow does order syncing work?\nWhen you accept a new Faire order, it will automatically sync that order to Shopify.\nThe order sent to Shopify will contain:\nFull information about each line item\nThe promotion applied to the order (if you were running one)\nCommission charged (if applicable)\nThe Faire order number and expected ship date\nCustomer information and shipping address\nTags for \u201cFaire\u201d and \u201cWholesale\u201d\nRelevant VAT information for European brands\nIf you track inventory counts in Shopify, inventory will automatically be deducted in Shopify for Faire products that are matched with a corresponding Shopify listing.\nAt this time, the integration will not retrieve fulfillment information from Shopify and pull it into Faire. You will still need to enter that information on Faire.\nIf you have not yet specified a matching preference for one or more items in the order, we won\u2019t send the order to Shopify. Specifying a matching preference means that you have either linked the Faire product with a Shopify product or expressly indicated that you don\u2019t want to link it with a Shopify product. Once you set the matching preferences for the remaining items, we\u2019ll sync the order to Shopify.\nCatalog Import\nThis can be used any time you\u2019d like to bring over new products from Shopify to Faire.\nThis is available once your initial integration setup above (steps 1-8) is complete.\nHow to import products from Shopify to Faire\nIn your Products tab on Faire, click the Add Products button and select Import From Shopify\nSelect the products you\u2019d like to import from Shopify to Faire. There are two options when choosing which products to import:\nAll products: This will import all products from Shopify to Faire\nTagged products: This will import all products with a specific tag on Shopify from Shopify to Faire. At this time, you can select one tag at a time.\nConfirm your selection and click Start Import to begin importing the selected products.\nYou will be prompted to confirm the pricing structure on Faire. This confirms the pricing structure you follow on Shopify.\nIf you select Wholesale pricing, this means that your Shopify page has products listed at a wholesale price, and that is the price that we will use as the wholesale price on Faire.\nIf you select Retail pricing, this means that your Shopify page has products listed at a retail price, and that is the price that we will use as the MSRP on Faire.\nThis selection will only need to be made once and will carry through for all imports going forward. You\u2019ll be able to edit your products in the product editor if needed. Click Continue once you have made your selection.\nNext, let us know how we should calculate your wholesale or retail price depending on your selection on the previous screen. We'll need to know:\nThe percentage increase of wholesale pricing that will be used for retail pricing, or\nThe reduction of retail pricing that will be used for wholesale pricing\nYou will also need to confirm the following information:\nProduct Type - If the product type is different for this import, you will need to add the product type after the import is completed. If it is the same, you can add the product type here to be assigned to all products being imported.\nCase Size - Whether you sell your products in a specific case size or not. If you don\u2019t, a case size of 1 will be assigned to every product. If different than 1, you will have the chance to assign a different case size to all products.\nA final pop-up window will confirm all of your selections before the import begins.\nOnce the import begins, you will see a pop-up in the bottom right corner of your page indicating that the import is running.\nA few things to note:\nYou can navigate away from this page. The import will continue to run.\nYou can cancel the import by clicking the X in the top right corner of the pop-up. This will prevent anything from importing any further, however, anything imported up to that point will remain on your Faire page as a draft.\nA few things to note:\nYou can navigate away from this page.

", "text": "VAT (value-added tax) will be applied to your orders based on where the brand is shipping the product from at the point of sale. Please see below to learn more about how we will manage domestic and international shipments.\nDomestic UK orders:\nFor any products that brands send from within the UK to a UK-based retailer, Faire will charge the retailer VAT at checkout for the transaction. This amount will then be automatically remitted to the brand in their order payout, where required. In the event that a retailer is purchasing from a non VAT-registered brand based in the UK, we will not charge the retailer any VAT on the transaction.\nInternational orders:\nFor VAT registered retailers, import VAT should not be charged at the border, as it should instead be reported in your VAT return via a process known as postponed accounting. Postponed accounting was introduced in the UK from 1 January 2021, and it allows importers, whose VAT registration numbers are included on the relevant import declaration and who intend on using the imported goods for their business, to account for import VAT via their VAT return (instead of at the time of import).\nFor non VAT registered retailers placing orders of less than \u00a3135, any applicable UK VAT will be charged at checkout. In this situation, UK marketplace rules apply, and VAT will be charged at checkout by Faire to the retailer.\nFor non VAT registered retailers placing orders of more than \u00a3135, import VAT and duties will be charged at the border when importing your products."}

Depending on the severity of the violation, when an email campaign has been identified by our system as having reached or exceeded our campaign bounce and/or spam rate thresholds, our system may temporarily or permanently suspend your ability to send additional emails - including your campaigns, automations, Faire Direct invitation emails, and Brand Referral emails.\nIf your email marketing tools have been suspended, you\u2019ll see a banner in your account notifying you of this update. In these instances, please reach out to our team for assistance through the Contact form below, and we will be here to help look into your case.

You\u2019ve made a campaign!\nSending campaigns from your business email address\nWe are happy to share that you can send campaigns from your business email address on Faire. Faire uses Postmark, a third-party email service, to allow you to connect your email address to your Faire account. Once confirmed, the email address you connected will be used for future email campaigns on Faire.\nTo set this up, simply go to your Account Settings page and find the \u201cConnected Accounts\u201d section. You can then follow the prompts to enter your email address. Please be sure to confirm the connection to Postmark through your email to complete the setup. Check your spam inbox just in case!\nPlease note: This feature will replace the previous Gmail integration on Faire.\nViewing your campaign results\nOnce you send out your campaign email, it will be labeled with a \u201cSending\u201d status to let you know it\u2019s on the way to your chosen recipients. Sending time will be immediate but can depend on the size of your recipient list, as larger lists may require more time to load.\nAfter the email has been sent, you\u2019ll see the status update to \u201cSent\u201d along with the analytics on the left hand side. These will include the Open %, Clicked %, $ Revenue, and Orders placed through the campaign email links.\nFor more information about your recipients, feel free to click into the campaign. Here you\u2019ll be able to export your recipient list to view which contacts received it successfully, unsubscribed, or bounced. You\u2019ll also see which customers have viewed and clicked on your campaign within the exported file.\nIf your campaign analytics are showing that 0 emails were delivered, we recommend making sure all the information has had time to properly load. Please allow up to 24 hours for all campaign analytics to fully load in the Faire portal.\nWhy do my campaign emails say 'unsent'?\nIn order to preserve the experience of retailers, our system limits the amount of marketing campaign emails that retailers can receive in a day.\nHere are the details of our emailing system for faire.com domains:\nEach retailer can receive up to 2 campaign emails from brands on Faire across a 24 hour period\nEach brand can email a retailer once every 24 hours\nEx: If you haven't emailed your retailer in the past 24 hours and the retailer hasn't been emailed by 2 other brands in the past 24 hours, your email will be sent!\nIf your retailer recipient has already reached their email limit, any campaign you try to send them that day will say \"unsent\" and the email will not send to the recipient. Please also keep in mind that if a retailer reports a campaign as spam, bounced, or unsubscribed from your marketing list, they will not receive your future campaigns. Read more about our Spam and Bounce requirements here.\nNote that you do have the option to send campaigns from your business email address domain instead of the faire.com domain, which means you will not be subject to the limits above that result in unsent emails. However, please note that brands may notice a drop in campaign open rate after switching, depending on how strong of a reputation you've already built with your email domain.\nEmail Marketing campaign limits during Faire Markets\nBased on feedback from past Faire Markets, we learned that some retailers felt overwhelmed by the volume of brand email campaigns they received leading up to and during the event. Some retailers reported receiving over 100 brand email campaigns per day. This experience resulted in significantly reduced open rates and engagement with brand sent email campaigns. Further analysis showed us that retailers are more likely to open and engage when they receive relevant emails at the right frequency.\nHow are we improving this?\nWe know that keeping your brand top-of-mind with your customers is crucial to developing long-lasting relationships and consistent sales - especially during time-sensitive events like Faire Market.\nTo improve the effectiveness of your email marketing efforts, we are implementing limits to the number of emails a retailer can receive leading up to and during our upcoming Faire Market, from June 26 to July 20. This effort is not intended to limit your reach, but instead to increase the impact and success of your campaigns. At the same time, we aim to preserve the retailer\u2019s experience by ensuring that they receive email campaigns from brands they purchase from and engage with the most.\nWe want to help you reach your customers who are most likely to purchase, which is why we\u2019ve classified the below relationship types based on data that shows that brands get 2x more engagement* on emails they send to new leads or customers who have ordered with them in the past year. These limits do not affect your ability to send email campaigns, but they will limit the number of recipients your campaigns are delivered to.\nPlease note that these relationship based limits will only apply from June 26 to July 20, but will apply to all brands, regardless of whether you participate in the upcoming Faire Market or not.\nHow does it work?\nIn a 24 hour period, a retailer can receive a maximum of 3 email campaigns from brands on Faire with which they have an inactive Faire customer or inactive contact relationship. While this applies to both faire.com and business domains, this change is in addition to our current rate limit on faire.com domains specifically.\nWe categorize your customer contacts into 4 types based on their relationship with your brand on Faire:\nActive Faire customer: The retailer has ordered from your brand on Faire in the past 12 months\nInactive Faire customer: The retailer last ordered from your brand on Faire over 12 months ago\nNew contact: You invited the retailer to purchase from your brand on Faire within the last 3 months, and the retailer has not yet ordered from your brand on Faire\nInactive contact: You invited the retailer to purchase from your brand on Faire 3+ months ago, and the retailer has not yet ordered from your brand on Faire\nA contact is considered \u2018invited\u2019 if you\u2019ve sent them a Faire Direct Invite email after adding them to your Customers list. You can view the customers you\u2019ve invited by using the Invite Sent filter in your Customers page. For more on Faire Direct Invite emails visit Adding and emailing my customers.\nIn addition to the above relationship based limits, a retailer can receive up to 1 email campaign from your brand within a 24 hour period.\nHow should I approach my Faire Market email campaign strategy?\nWe recommend segmenting your customers to focus your email marketing efforts towards your active Faire customer and new contact relationships. This practice will increase the delivery rate, and most importantly improve the relevance and engagement of your email campaign.\nHere is how you can use the existing filters within your Customers page to segment your contacts:\nUse the Last ordered filter and select a Custom date range. Inputting a range dating back 12 months to include the July 2022 Faire Market will create a segment for what we consider your active Faire customers.\nUse the Invite sent filter and select a Custom date range, then input a range dating back 3 months. Next, add the Total orders filter and select equal to \u201c0\u201d. This will create a segment for what we consider your new contact customers.\nWe also encourage you to leverage additional marketing channels like social media to help drive awareness of your market participation. To learn more about the upcoming Faire Market, see our guide here.\n*Based on brand-sent emails sent to active Faire customers or new contacts vs other audiences from January-April 2023\nWhy did my campaign email 'bounce'?\nThe status \u201cbounced\u201d means that your email was not able to be delivered to the recipient\u2019s inbox. For email campaigns sent through Faire, we categorize bounced emails as either \u201chard bounces\u201d or \u201csoft bounces\u201d.\nHard bounce: this typically means that the recipient\u2019s email no longer exists or their email server has blocked the email from reaching their inbox.\nSoft bounce: this typically means there is a temporary issue with the recipient\u2019s email such as a full inbox, or an issue with the email server (i.e., the email doesn\u2019t meet sender requirements, anti-spam requirements, etc). You\u2019re welcome to email these contacts again in the future, given they might have only been facing a temporary issue.\nNote: if the email address continues to soft bounce after several email attempts, we will then categorize it as a hard bounce.\nLarge-scale campaigns will be sent out in batches through our email system. Please be aware that sending campaigns to a large audience will take more time to complete. When an email campaign has been identified by our system as having reached or exceeded our 10% bounce threshold, our system may temporarily or permanently suspend your ability to send additional campaigns, automations, and Faire Direct invitation emails. Our third-party email delivery service monitors the bounce and spam rates of your marketing emails and they determine the consequence of any policy violations.\nIf you notice an email campaign you\u2019ve sent has a high percentage of hard-bounced email addresses, we recommend assessing your contact list to ensure it is up-to-date and contains only active, vetted customers or leads. This is very important to ensure that you do not lose access to your email marketing tools on Faire, as this is the only way to email Marketplace customers you acquire from Faire.\nOnce an email address hard-bounces, we will not send future campaigns to that email address, so there is no need to remove them from your list.\nPlease also keep in mind that if a retailer reports a campaign as spam or unsubscribes from your marketing list, they will not receive your future campaigns. That being said, spam rates are monitored very closely by our third-party email delivery service, so please make sure you are only emailing contacts that are legitimate businesses (e.g., they are a retailer, they are still in business), who you have an existing business relationship with or have interacted with before, or\u2013\u2013in the case of new leads\u2013\u2013you believe they would welcome hearing from you.\nWe highly recommend referencing our Bounce and spam rate requirements to learn more about the bounce threshold, including what to do if your email privileges are suspended after surpassing the threshold."}

Retailers are welcome to invite brands to apply by submitting a brand referral directly in their Faire portal.\nThey can also be rewarded with shopping credit - And it's all funded by Faire!\nHere's how it works\nRetailers on Faire are encouraged to share their referral link with any brand they\u2019d like to invite, as long as they have received consent to contact them. When a brand uses a retailer\u2019s referral link to apply for a Faire account, that retailer will be eligible to receive a Faire-funded credit reward.\nIf a brand is invited by more than one retailer or brand, the referral credit will go to the person whose referral link is used to apply. If no referral link is used to apply, brands are also asked during the onboarding process if anyone referred them. Then they can search by name or email to select their referrer.\nWith every new order a brand receives in their first 30 days of joining, their referring retailer will receive Faire-funded credits in their account as a reward.\nPlease note that we will not be exposing any specific order information to the retailer (such as the ordering customer identity, order total, items in the order, etc). This information will continue to be private in each brand's Faire portal and no private information will be shared.\nIf you're interested in learning about how you can refer a fellow brand, check out our other referral program here: Can I invite other brands to join Faire?"}
