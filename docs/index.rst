Welcome to LocalRQA's documentation!
===================================

LocalRQA is an open-source toolkit that enables researchers and developers to easily train, test, and deploy retrival-augmented QA  (RQA) systems using techniques from recent research. Given a collection of documents, you can use pre-built pipelines in our framework to quickly assemble an RQA system using the best off-the-shelf models. Alternatively, you can **create your own training data, train open-source models using algorithms from the latest research, and deploy your very own local RQA system**!

ðŸŒŸ Why LocalRQA?
==================


LocalRQA is a toolkit designed to make researching and developing retrival-augmented QA systems more efficient and effective. It offers a variety of **training** methods curated from latest research (see :ref:`train-main`) and **automatic evaluation** metrics (see :ref:`evaluation-main`) to help users develop new RQA approaches and compare with prior work.

Moreover, LocalRQA doesn't just stop at creating these systems; it also provides tools for **deploying** these systems and improving them through real-world feedback (see :ref:`serving-main`). We offer support with popular inference acceleration frameworks such as ``vLLM`` and ``SGLang``, as well as methods to directly launch your RQA system with an interactive UI to allow users to chat with your system and provide feedback!

With a comprehensive suite of tools, LocalRQA aims to make it easier for researchers and developers to train, test, and deploy novel RQA approaches!
